# How Telepresence works

We can use Telepresence to help us running KubeSphere apiserver locally.
Here is the toplogy of our services(ks-apiserver and openpitrix).Through this toplogy
we can understand how it works, which is conducive to our development.

## What telepresence has done
1. Created a proxy in kubernetes cluster. 
2. A two-way network tunel is established between the development machine and remote kubernetes cluster.thus,your local process can connect with the remote kubernetes cluster.

## How a request is processed
If you want to debug your local ks-apiserver process with telepresence, your request will follow the dotted line.
The solid line represents how a request is processed in production environment.

## How to debug a service in kubesphere
1. run telepresence like this 
```jshelllanguage
telepresence --namespace kubesphere-system --swap-deployment ks-apiserver --expose 9090:9090 --run go run ./cmd/ks-apiserver/apiserver.go
```
the option of --swap-deployment tell kubernetes replace remote ks-apiserver with your local process in kubesphere-system namespace,
replace means scale the real ks-apiser deployment to 0, and then create a new deployment that proxy your local ks-apiserver process.
factly, the proxy in topology is the new deployment of ks-apiserver. when you exit telepresence session, kubernetes will scale ks-apiserver deployment(proxy)
to 0, and scale the real to 1 or other nums.
