# Architecture

KubeSphere separates [frontend](https://github.com/kubesphere/console) from [backend](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere), and it itself is a cloud native application and provides open standard REST APIs for external systems to use. Please see [API documentation](https://kubesphere.io/docs/api-reference/api-docs) for details. The following figure is the system architecture. KubeSphere can run anywhere from on-premise datacenter to any cloud to edge. In addition, it can be deployed on any Kubernetes distribution.
