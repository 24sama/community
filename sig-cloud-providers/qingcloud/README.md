# QingCloud

The place is used to plan and design QingCloud QKE which is the Kubernetes service with KubeSphere enabled.

## General Idea

[QingCloud QKE](https://appcenter.qingcloud.com/apps/app-cmgbd5k2/KubeSphere%C2%AE%EF%B8%8F%20(QKE)) is a fully managed Kubernetes service on QingCloud with KubeSphere deployed as its management console. QKE integrates with QingCloud IaaS such as storage services, network etc. [KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io) is a one-stop container platform with rich pluggable features on top of Kubernetes. With KubeSphere, users will have a powerful web console to manage their workloads, services and infrastructure.
