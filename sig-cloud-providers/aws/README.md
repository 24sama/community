# AWS

The place is used to plan and design the collaboration between KubeSphere and AWS EKS.

## General Idea

[AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a fully managed Kubernetes service on AWS. [KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io) is a one-stop container platform with rich pluggable features on top of Kubernetes. With KubeSphere, users will have a powerful web console to manage their workloads, services and infrastructure. Therefore, the integration of AWS EKS and KubeSphere will give AWS users a good option to manage their EKS.

## Quick start of KubeSphere and EKS integration

First we are going to integrate KubeSphere into AWS EKS through [Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/). Please check the [roadmap](./roadmap.md).
